## Development

Championify works like any basic android studio project. A config file simply needs to be created for the Champion.gg API key. PRs are welcome.

Create a new file at `/app/src/main/res/values/configs.xml`

```xml
<resources>
    <string name="championgg">CHAMPIONGG KEY</string>
</resources>
```
